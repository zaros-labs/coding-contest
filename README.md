Challenge for Backend

## Description

Create a Typescript NodeJS Express API Rest that fetches the subgraph and return the values on the endpoint.

### Requirements

- GET endpoint
- Folders with standards
- Types
- Unit tests
- Queries
- Env
- Cache optimization

## Details

Using `graphql-request` setup the client using TheGraph, alchemy or any other subgraph. Use any contract address to get any log. Ex: token was minted, transferred or a log that makes sense. Return in the GET route the response of the fetched subgraph. Optimize the cache using another lib, manual memory ram states or any other idea.
